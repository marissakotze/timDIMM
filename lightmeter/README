 requires libusb
 tested under Fedora    10 (64 bit on an AMD X2)
              Ubuntu  8.04 (64 bit on an IntelCore2 Duo)
              Ubuntu  9.04 (64 bit on an IntelCore2 Duo)
              Ubuntu 10.04 (32 bit Intel Atom)
 under operation @ Innsbruck observatory under Ubuntu 9.04
              (32 bit on an AMD Athlon 1.3GHz)
 but it us rather strictly ANSI C and thus should work

 version 4.1
 changes: 
    - as the USB devices are running offline from time to time
      a recovery was implemented dealing even with a complete internal reset
      (occurs only when trying to read the temperature)
    - all "non data" lines start with the character # 
      (for easier filtering with plot programs)
    - USB errors / resets are indicated in the output file
    

2010-11-21: adaption to Mark2.3l version; GW.

     In case of problems write to lightmeter@kuffner-sternwarte.at 

--------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALL

1)
Installation of additional library: libusb
Fedora: (not tested for Mark 2.3l but should work)
	yum install libusb
Ubuntu & Debian:
        Ubuntu, tested to 10.4:
	sudo apt-get install libusb++-dev
possibly
	sudo apt-get install libusb

2) 
change to destination directory e.g.:
    cd /home/myname/Lightmeter/
download/copy the LightmeterMark2.3l.zip to this location

unpack source and compile it
    unzip LightmeterMark2.3l.zip 
go into the unpacked directory LightmeterMark2.3l, e.g.
    cd LightmeterMark2.3l           
    
    make

3)
change to user root or do setup with sudo:
    Fedora:
       su root
       make setup
    Ubuntu & Debian:
       sudo make setup

--------------------------------------------------------------------
RUNNING:

     lightmeter_mark23l [sampling]
         the (optional) parameter sets the intervals between
         readouts in seconds (default = 1 second)

The program writes to the terminal/screen stdout, i.e.
    lightmeter_mark23l
sends the output directly to your screen. Use ctrl C to stop.
With e.g.
    lightmeter_mark23l > Light_`date +%Y_%m_%d_%H_%M`.csv &
it will write every second to a file with the starting date in the
name: Light_YYYY_MM_DD_hh_mm.csv

Write every 5 seconds:
    lightmeter_mark23l 5 > Light_`date +%Y_%m_%d_%H_%M`.csv &


----------------------------------------------------------------------

AUTOMATIC RUNNING:

I have a cron jobs setup to rotate the logfiles every 24 hours
(@ noon) and send those files to my web server. For the automated copy
to the web server the accounts have to be connected with an ssh key
(see "man ssh-keygen" for details)

A)
I am using script "start_lightmeter" to start it after reboot and the
command line /home/stefan/start_lightmeter in the file /etc/rc.local
(Ubuntu and Debian) or /etc/rc5.d/S99local (Fedora)

#!/bin/csh
cd /home/stefan
if (-e /home/stefan/data.txt) gzip /home/stefan/data.txt
if (-e /home/stefan/data.txt.gz) \
   scp -q data.txt.gz \
   stefan@ast7.uibk.ac.at:public_html/LIGHT/light_ibk_60cm_`date +%Y_%m_%d_%H_%M`dat.gz
rm -f data.txt.gz
nohup /home/stefan/lightmeter_usb > /home/stefan/data.txt &

B)
The crontab file has an entry:

# exchange the measurement always at noon
# m h dom mon dow user	command
00 12 * * *	/home/stefan/rotate_log

and a script "rotate_log" for rotation of the logfiles (here Ubuntu /
Debian version - fedora user have to run / add it to the system-wide
crontab and may remove the section: echo 'MY_USER_PASSWORD' | sudo -S kill

#!/bin/csh
cd /home/stefan
# stop the current measurement
(echo 'MY_USER_PASSWORD' | sudo -S kill -HUP `pgrep  lightmeter_usb` >& /dev/null) > /dev/null
sleep 1
if (-e /home/stefan/data.txt) gzip /home/stefan/data.txt
if (-e /home/stefan/data.txt.gz) \
   scp -q data.txt.gz \
   stefan@ast7.uibk.ac.at:public_html/LIGHT/light_ibk_60cm_`date +%Y_%m_%d_%H_%M`dat.gz
rm -f data.txt.gz
# start a new one
nohup /home/stefan/lightmeter_usb > /home/stefan/data.txt &
